# Task ID: 28
# Title: Enhanced Mastery Assessment and Learning Path Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive system for advanced mastery assessment and learning path optimization that includes multi-dimensional competency tracking, predictive analytics, and dynamic path adaptation to create personalized, effective learning experiences.
# Details:
This task encompasses the development of three interconnected systems:

1. Multi-Dimensional Mastery Assessment Framework for granular competency tracking and holistic assessment
2. Predictive Analytics for Learning Path Optimization to identify optimal learning sequences
3. Dynamic Path Adaptation and Integration Systems for real-time personalization

These components will work together to create a sophisticated educational intelligence system that accurately measures student mastery across multiple dimensions while continuously optimizing their learning paths based on performance data and predictive models.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will include:

1. Unit tests for each component of the mastery assessment and learning path optimization systems
2. Integration tests to verify proper communication between components
3. Performance testing to ensure the system can handle expected user loads
4. A/B testing framework to validate the effectiveness of learning path recommendations
5. User acceptance testing with educators and students to verify usability and value
6. Validation of AI-generated insights against expert educator assessments
7. Privacy and security audits to ensure compliance with educational data standards
