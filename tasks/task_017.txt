# Task ID: 17
# Title: Interoperability and Standards Compliance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 15, 21
# Priority: low
# Description: Implement standards support and third-party integration capabilities
# Details:
Implement LTI 1.3 Tool Provider support for integration with other LMS platforms. Create OneRoster 1.2 API for roster and grade synchronization. Implement Caliper Analytics for data export. Build SCORM 1.2/2004 export functionality for courses and content. Create the AI Skills Marketplace architecture with secure plug-in system (iframe + postMessage). Implement the custom model fine-tuning interface for institutions to train domain-specific models. Build API documentation and developer guides for third-party integration.

**PRD Context**
The platform must support the following education technology standards to ensure broad compatibility with existing systems:
- LTI 1.3 Advantage (Tool Provider launch): Enable the platform to be launched from other LMS systems
- SCORM 1.2/2004 export wizard: Allow course content to be exported in SCORM-compliant packages
- Caliper Analytics event emission: Support standardized learning analytics data collection
- OneRoster synchronization: Enable automated roster and grade data exchange with SIS systems

# Test Strategy:
Test LTI launch flows with sample consumer applications. Verify OneRoster API correctly synchronizes roster and grade data. Test SCORM export and import in a standard-compliant LMS. Check that the Skills Marketplace securely integrates third-party tools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement LTI 1.3 Tool Provider Support [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary components to enable the platform to function as an LTI 1.3 Tool Provider, allowing it to be launched from other Learning Management Systems.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication flow for LTI 1.3 including JWT token validation
2. Create registration endpoints for platform configuration
3. Implement the launch URL endpoint that handles incoming LTI launches
4. Build user context mapping to associate LTI users with platform accounts
5. Implement LTI Advantage services (Assignment and Grade Services, Deep Linking, Names and Role Provisioning)
6. Create admin interface for managing LTI integrations and configurations

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for JWT validation and OAuth flows
- Integration tests with mock LTI Consumer requests
- End-to-end testing with common LMS platforms (Canvas, Moodle, Blackboard)
- Security testing for proper validation of launch parameters

## 2. Develop OneRoster 1.2 API and SCORM Export Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a standards-compliant OneRoster 1.2 API for roster and grade synchronization with Student Information Systems, and implement SCORM 1.2/2004 export capabilities for courses and content.
### Details:
Implementation steps:

OneRoster 1.2 API:
1. Design RESTful API endpoints following OneRoster 1.2 specifications
2. Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication for API access
3. Create data models and mappings between platform data and OneRoster format
4. Build endpoints for classes, enrollments, users, and grades
5. Implement CSV bulk data exchange option

SCORM Export:
1. Create a SCORM package generator service that converts course content to SCORM 1.2/2004 format
2. Implement manifest file (imsmanifest.xml) generation
3. Build content packaging system that bundles resources and metadata
4. Create a user interface wizard for SCORM export options
5. Implement progress tracking conversion to SCORM CMI data model

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for data transformation logic
- API compliance testing against OneRoster certification test suite
- Validation of generated SCORM packages with standard SCORM players
- Integration tests with SIS systems for OneRoster compatibility
- End-to-end testing of the export wizard UI

## 3. Implement Caliper Analytics and AI Skills Marketplace [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2
### Description: Build Caliper Analytics event emission for standardized learning data collection and create the AI Skills Marketplace architecture with a secure plug-in system and custom model fine-tuning interface.
### Details:
Implementation steps:

Caliper Analytics:
1. Implement Caliper 1.1 sensor API for event emission
2. Create event mappers for platform activities (content views, assessments, etc.)
3. Build a configuration interface for Caliper endpoints
4. Implement secure credential management for Caliper endpoints
5. Create event queuing and batch processing for reliability

AI Skills Marketplace:
1. Design secure iframe-based plugin architecture using postMessage for communication
2. Implement plugin registration and validation system
3. Create sandbox environment for third-party AI models
4. Build the custom model fine-tuning interface with dataset management
5. Implement model versioning and deployment pipeline
6. Create comprehensive API documentation and developer guides
7. Build developer portal with SDK, examples, and testing tools

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for event generation and formatting
- Security testing for iframe isolation and postMessage validation
- Validation of Caliper events against the specification
- Integration tests with Caliper endpoints
- Performance testing for event processing at scale
- End-to-end testing of the marketplace plugin system
- User testing of the model fine-tuning interface
