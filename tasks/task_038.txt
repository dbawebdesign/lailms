# Task ID: 38
# Title: Implement First Course Generation Workflow for Knowledge Base System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the initial course generation workflow that processes the first document uploaded to the knowledge base and transforms it into a structured course with appropriate learning modules.
# Details:
Building on Task 37's overall system design, this task focuses specifically on implementing the workflow for the first course generation from a knowledge base document. Key implementation requirements:

1. Create a document processing pipeline that:
   - Validates the uploaded document format (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
   - Extracts text content with proper formatting preservation
   - Identifies section headers, subheadings, and content hierarchy

2. Implement content analysis components:
   - Topic extraction and categorization
   - Key concept identification
   - Difficulty level assessment
   - Prerequisite relationship mapping

3. Develop course structure generation logic:
   - Module organization based on document sections
   - Lesson sequencing following logical learning progression
   - Appropriate pacing and content density per lesson
   - Generation of learning objectives for each module

4. Create a course preview interface that allows:
   - Visualization of the generated course structure
   - Manual adjustment of module/lesson organization
   - Editing of auto-generated learning objectives
   - Confirmation workflow to finalize the course

5. Implement data persistence layer to store:
   - Original document reference
   - Extracted content in structured format
   - Generated course structure
   - Metadata about the generation process

The implementation should focus on a smooth end-to-end workflow for the first document, with appropriate error handling and progress indicators throughout the process.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the complete workflow functions correctly:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test document validation for various file types (valid PDFs, DOCXs, TXTs and invalid formats)
   - Test content extraction accuracy with sample documents containing known structures
   - Test topic extraction and categorization with pre-classified content
   - Test course structure generation with predefined inputs and expected outputs

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify end-to-end workflow from document upload to course generation
   - Test persistence of all required data throughout the process
   - Verify proper error handling for various failure scenarios

3. User Acceptance Tests:
   - Upload real-world documents of varying complexity and verify course structure quality
   - Assess learning objective generation for clarity and relevance
   - Evaluate module organization for logical progression
   - Test the course preview and editing interface for usability

4. Performance Tests:
   - Measure processing time for documents of different sizes (5 pages, 20 pages, 100+ pages)
   - Verify system resource usage remains within acceptable limits
   - Test concurrent processing of multiple documents

5. Validation Criteria:
   - Course structure should maintain the logical flow of the original document
   - Learning objectives should be clear, measurable, and aligned with content
   - All document sections should be appropriately represented in the course
   - The preview interface should accurately display the generated structure
