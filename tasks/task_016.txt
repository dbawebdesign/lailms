# Task ID: 16
# Title: Personalization and Adaptive Learning
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement personalized learning paths and adaptive content delivery
# Details:
Create the system for continuous adaptivity that adjusts lesson complexity, format, and pace based on learner performance. Implement the goal-driven pathway replanning that allows students to set objectives and receive customized learning paths. Build the personalized dashboards with 'next steps', time-to-complete estimates, and recommended learning modes. Create the targeted remediation and enrichment system that automatically generates appropriate assignments based on student needs. Implement API routes for personalization and adaptive learning with proper RLS enforcement.

**PRD Context**

- **Adaptive Learning Mechanisms**: The system should dynamically adjust difficulty and pace based on real-time performance metrics. When students consistently perform well, content should increase in complexity; when struggling, the system should provide more scaffolding and slower progression.

- **Variant Lesson Formats**: Content should be available in multiple formats (text, video, interactive exercises, etc.) with the system recommending the most effective format based on individual learning patterns and preferences.

- **Integration with Generative Course Designer**: The adaptive system should leverage the branching paths created by the Generative Course Designer to offer alternative learning routes when students struggle with the primary path.

- **Connection to Mastery Tracking**: Personalization should be informed by the Mastery Tracking system's data on concept understanding, using granular skill assessments to target specific knowledge gaps.

- **Continuous Adaptation**: The system should continuously refine its personalization model based on ongoing student interactions, creating an increasingly tailored experience over time.

# Test Strategy:
Test adaptive content delivery with different student performance patterns. Verify goal-driven replanning creates appropriate learning paths. Check that personalized dashboards display relevant information. Test remediation and enrichment generation for struggling and advanced students. Validate that the system correctly integrates with the Generative Course Designer's branching paths and the Mastery Tracking system. Test the dynamic adjustment of content difficulty and pace based on various performance scenarios. Verify that lesson format recommendations align with user learning patterns and preferences.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Adaptive Learning Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational engine that tracks student performance and adjusts content difficulty, pace, and format based on real-time metrics
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design and implement a data model for storing student performance metrics (completion rates, assessment scores, time spent, etc.)
2. Create algorithms to analyze performance patterns and determine when to adjust difficulty
3. Implement the core adaptation logic with rules for:
   - Increasing complexity when performance exceeds thresholds
   - Providing additional scaffolding when performance falls below thresholds
   - Adjusting pace based on completion time metrics
4. Build API endpoints for:
   - Retrieving personalized content recommendations
   - Submitting performance data for analysis
   - Requesting difficulty adjustments
5. Implement proper RLS policies to ensure data security

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for adaptation algorithms with various performance scenarios
- Integration tests with mock student data to verify appropriate content adjustments
- Performance testing to ensure the engine can handle concurrent requests
- Security testing to verify RLS enforcement

## 2. Develop Goal-Driven Learning Pathways [pending]

### Description: Build the system that allows students to set learning objectives and generates customized learning paths with alternative routes based on performance
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a data model for learning objectives and pathway mapping
2. Implement a pathway generation algorithm that:
   - Maps learning objectives to required skills and content
   - Creates primary and alternative learning routes
   - Integrates with the Generative Course Designer's branching paths
3. Build a replanning mechanism that adjusts pathways based on:
   - Student performance data from the adaptive engine
   - Changes in student goals or priorities
4. Develop API endpoints for:
   - Setting and updating learning objectives
   - Retrieving personalized learning paths
   - Requesting pathway replanning
5. Integrate with the Mastery Tracking system to incorporate skill assessment data

Testing approach:
