# Task ID: 20
# Title: Testing, Documentation, and Launch Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive testing, create documentation, and prepare for launch
# Details:
Implement unit tests for core functionality with Jest. Create integration tests with Playwright for end-to-end testing. Conduct accessibility testing with axe-core to ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Perform security audits and penetration testing. Create user documentation for all roles. Develop administrator guides for system configuration and management. Build training materials and onboarding processes. Set up support systems and feedback channels. Prepare marketing materials and launch communications. Configure analytics tracking for post-launch monitoring.

**PRD Context**
- Testing Coverage: Achieve minimum 80% test coverage for unit and integration tests
- Test Types Required: 
  * Linting tests
  * Type checking
  * Unit tests with Jest
  * End-to-end tests with Playwright
  * Accessibility testing with axe-core for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
  * Visual regression testing
- Documentation Requirements:
  * Complete user documentation for all user roles
  * Administrator guides for system configuration
  * Training materials for onboarding
- Launch Readiness:
  * Support systems and feedback channels must be operational
  * Analytics tracking configured for post-launch monitoring
  * Security audits and penetration testing completed

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage meets or exceeds 80% target. Check accessibility compliance with automated and manual testing. Review documentation for completeness and clarity. Test support systems and feedback channels with sample scenarios. Ensure all CI/CD pipeline tests (lint, type, unit, e2e, a11y, visual regression) pass successfully before launch.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Comprehensive Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and implement all required testing frameworks and achieve minimum 80% test coverage
### Details:
1. Configure Jest for unit testing:
   - Set up Jest configuration file with appropriate settings
   - Create test utilities and mocks for common dependencies
   - Implement unit tests for core functionality focusing on business logic components

2. Implement end-to-end testing with Playwright:
   - Set up Playwright configuration for multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Create test fixtures and helpers for common user flows
   - Implement critical path tests covering main user journeys
   - Add tests for edge cases and error handling

3. Configure and implement accessibility testing:
   - Integrate axe-core into the testing pipeline
   - Create automated tests to verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Document any exceptions or areas requiring manual verification

4. Set up visual regression testing:
   - Configure visual snapshot testing tools
   - Create baseline screenshots for key UI components and pages
   - Implement comparison tests to detect unintended visual changes

5. Implement linting and type checking in CI pipeline:
   - Configure ESLint and TypeScript checking as part of the test suite
   - Ensure all code passes linting and type checking requirements

Testing approach: Run unit tests during development and in CI pipeline. Schedule longer-running integration and end-to-end tests to run nightly. Generate coverage reports and set up alerts for coverage drops below 80%.

## 2. Create Comprehensive Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Develop all required documentation for users, administrators, and training purposes
### Details:
1. Create user documentation for all roles:
   - Document all features and functionality with step-by-step instructions
   - Include screenshots and examples for common tasks
   - Organize documentation by user role (regular users, power users, etc.)
   - Create a searchable knowledge base structure

2. Develop administrator guides:
   - Document system configuration options and best practices
   - Create troubleshooting guides for common issues
   - Include security recommendations and maintenance procedures
   - Document API endpoints and integration options if applicable

3. Build training materials and onboarding processes:
   - Create guided tutorials for new users
   - Develop interactive walkthroughs for key features
   - Create video demonstrations for complex workflows
   - Design onboarding checklists for different user types

4. Set up documentation infrastructure:
   - Implement a versioning system for documentation
   - Create a feedback mechanism for documentation improvements
   - Ensure documentation is accessible and follows best practices

Testing approach: Conduct user testing with the documentation to ensure clarity and completeness. Have team members unfamiliar with specific features attempt to use them with only the documentation as guidance. Iterate based on feedback.

## 3. Prepare for Product Launch [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Complete security audits, set up support systems, and configure analytics for launch readiness
### Details:
1. Conduct security audits and penetration testing:
   - Perform automated security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP
   - Conduct manual penetration testing focusing on authentication and data protection
   - Address all critical and high-priority security findings
   - Document security measures for compliance purposes

2. Set up support systems and feedback channels:
   - Implement a ticketing system for user support
   - Create templates for common support scenarios
   - Set up automated issue reporting from the application
   - Establish SLAs and support workflows
   - Create a feedback collection mechanism within the application

3. Configure analytics tracking:
   - Implement analytics tracking for key user actions and conversion points
   - Set up dashboards for monitoring user engagement
   - Configure alerts for critical metrics
   - Ensure analytics implementation complies with privacy regulations

4. Prepare marketing materials and launch communications:
   - Create announcement templates for different channels
   - Develop a launch timeline and communication schedule
   - Prepare FAQ documents for common questions
   - Create assets for social media and other promotional channels

Testing approach: Conduct a full launch rehearsal with the team, simulating the actual launch process. Test all support channels and analytics tracking in a staging environment. Verify that security measures are properly implemented through third-party validation.
