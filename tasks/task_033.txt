# Task ID: 33
# Title: Test Luna's Dynamic Action Button Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 32
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive test cases for Luna's dynamic action buttons, focusing on confirmation dialogs, yes/no choices, and workflow navigation to ensure proper user interaction throughout the application.
# Details:
This task involves creating and executing test cases to verify that Luna's dynamic action buttons function correctly across various scenarios:

1. **Confirmation Dialog Testing**:
   - Test Luna's ability to generate confirmation dialogs when users request actions that require verification
   - Verify that "Yes/No" buttons appear correctly when Luna asks for confirmation
   - Test edge cases where confirmation might be ambiguous or complex

2. **Lesson Creation Confirmation Flow**:
   - Ask Luna to create a new lesson and verify that appropriate confirmation buttons appear
   - Test the complete flow from request to confirmation to execution
   - Verify proper handling of both affirmative and negative responses

3. **Content Modification Confirmation**:
   - Request Luna to make changes to existing content that should trigger confirmation
   - Test modification scenarios with varying levels of impact (minor edits vs. major changes)
   - Verify that confirmation buttons appear with appropriate context and warning messages

4. **Multi-step Workflow Navigation**:
   - Test Luna's ability to guide users through multi-step processes using dynamic buttons
   - Verify that button state changes appropriately as users progress through workflows
   - Test navigation between steps, including going back or canceling mid-workflow

5. **Button Styling and Accessibility**:
   - Verify that buttons follow the design system guidelines for different variants
   - Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
   - Ensure buttons have appropriate hover/focus states and visual feedback

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Test scenarios where button actions might fail
   - Verify appropriate error messages and recovery options
   - Test timeout scenarios and connection issues

7. **Cross-browser and Responsive Testing**:
   - Verify button functionality across different browsers and devices
   - Test responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

8. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure response time between request and button appearance
   - Test button rendering performance with multiple simultaneous actions

# Test Strategy:
1. **Create Test Matrix**:
   - Document all test scenarios in a spreadsheet with expected outcomes
   - Include positive paths, negative paths, and edge cases
   - Prioritize tests based on frequency and criticality

2. **Manual Testing Procedure**:
   - For each test case, document the exact prompt to give Luna
   - Record expected button appearance, text, and behavior
   - Execute tests and document actual results with screenshots
   - Note any discrepancies between expected and actual behavior

3. **Confirmation Dialog Testing**:
   - Ask Luna: "Can you create a new lesson about photosynthesis?"
   - Verify "Yes" and "No" buttons appear with appropriate styling
   - Test both responses and verify correct system behavior
   - Repeat with: "Would you like to delete this section?" and verify warning styling

4. **Cross-functional Testing**:
   - Test button functionality across different application areas:
     - Lesson Studio
     - Course Designer
     - Assessment Builder
     - Student Study Space

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Create a set of standard prompts that should trigger action buttons
   - Run these tests after any changes to the button component library
   - Automate basic tests using Playwright or Cypress if possible

6. **User Acceptance Testing**:
   - Create guided test scenarios for non-technical users
   - Observe and document their interactions with Luna's buttons
   - Collect feedback on clarity, usability, and intuitiveness

7. **Documentation**:
   - Create a comprehensive report of all test results
   - Document any bugs or issues found with severity ratings
   - Provide recommendations for improvements
   - Update test cases for future regression testing
