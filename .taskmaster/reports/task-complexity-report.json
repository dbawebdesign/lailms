			"taskTitle": "Implement Database Schema Extensions",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema extension process into subtasks covering: (1) requirements gathering for new features, (2) detailed analysis of existing schema and relationships, (3) schema design for each new feature (notes, bookmarks, mind maps, sessions, AI conversations, content interactions), (4) drafting migration scripts, (5) peer review and documentation, (6) applying and testing migrations in staging, (7) validating data integrity and rollback procedures.",
			"reasoning": "Extending a production database schema to support multiple new interconnected features is complex, especially when integrating with existing tables and ensuring no redundancy or silos. Best practices require careful normalization, foreign key management, migration planning, and documentation[1][2][3][4]. Each new feature (notes, bookmarks, mind maps, etc.) may require its own schema changes and integration points, and robust testing is needed to ensure data integrity and maintainability."
