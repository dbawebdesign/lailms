## overview

Learnology AI is an **AI‑first learning‑management ecosystem** that replaces conventional LMS workflows with end‑to‑end generative, adaptive, and data‑rich experiences. Powered by GPT‑4.1-mini, Supabase, and a real‑time UI‑context engine ("Luna"), the platform lets institutions, instructors, students, and parents **create, deliver, study, assess, and analyse** learning content entirely through natural‑language interactions. It aims to address common LMS pain points like stale content, high instructor workload, one‑size‑fits‑all paths, and cumbersome UIs by leveraging end‑to‑end AI generation, zero static content derived from secure knowledgebases, tenant‑isolated AI models, and conversational interfaces. **The platform is designed with a modular architecture to ensure efficiency, component reusability, and adaptability for future product variations, including potential Homeschool and Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) learning platforms.**

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the **functional, non‑functional, and user‑experience requirements** for the initial GA release ("v1 – Skyline"). It consolidates *all* features enumerated in the **AI‑First LMS Master Blueprint** citeturn0file2 and the **Master Step‑by‑Step Build Process (Code‑First Edition)** citeturn0file0, ensuring full parity between specification and implementation.

### core api routes

| route                      | purpose                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `POST /api/upload-file`    | Upload → parse → chunk → embed → store                  |
| `POST /api/upload-youtube` | Fetch transcript → chunk → embed → store                |
| `POST /api/upload-url`     | Scrape page → chunk → embed → store                     |
| `POST /api/query`          | Semantic question → retrieve top chunks → GPT‑4o answer |

### detailed pipelines

1. **File upload** – upload to Supabase Storage → parse (pdf‑parse/mammoth) → chunk (\~400 tokens) → embed → save → enqueue summarisation.
2. **YouTube** – fetch transcript (or Whisper fallback) → time‑based chunk → embed → save → summarisation.
3. **Web URL** – scrape via Playwright/Readability → heading/paragraph chunks → embed → save → summarisation.

### background summarisation

Edge job runs per chunk:

```js
const summary = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: 'You are an expert summariser.' },
    { role: 'user', content: `Summarise the following text:\n\n${chunkText}` },
  ],
});
```

Writes `chunk_summary`, then cascades to section & full‑document summaries.

### frontend experience

| feature          | tech                                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| File/link upload | Drag‑and‑drop + paste link (React Dropzone)          |
| Upload status    | Supabase Realtime subscription on `documents.status` |
| Document viewer  | Headings sidebar + content panel (markdown render)   |
| Search & ask     | Text box → streaming GPT‑4o answer via SSE           |
| Summaries view   | Chunk‑, section‑, and doc‑level summaries accordion  |

### production hardening checklist

- **Retry & resumable uploads**
- **Batched embeddings** (≤ 20 per request)
- **Token budgeting & model fallback**
- **Streaming OpenAI responses** to UI
- **Supabase Auth** – row‑level user isolation

### premium ideas & differentiators

| feature             | value add                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Timestamp deep‑link | Click YouTube chunk → seek video to exact timestamp |
| Highlight mode      | Highlight matching paragraphs in viewer on answer   |
| Cross‑doc search    | Vector join across multiple `document_id` values    |
| Multi‑source QA     | Select documents subset before asking a question    |

Learnology AI – Master Step‑by‑Step Build Process (Code‑First Edition)
Updated to remove all Figma dependence and embed a full in‑repo Style Guide. Every UI/UX artifact, role screen, and component is enumerated below so nothing is missed.

🌐 0. Global Foundations & Operating Principles
Tech Stack
• Frontend: Next.js 14 + React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 3, shadcn/ui.
• Design Tokens: Centralised packages/ui/styleGuide.ts (see §1) – sole source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, shadows, motion.
• AI Layer: OpenAI GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT‑4o / GPT‑4o‑mini; Gemini 2.5 Pro via Cursor Agent for code generation.
• Backend: Supabase (Postgres + pgvector, Auth, Realtime, Storage).
• Jobs: Inngest Functions ≤ 45 s.
• Repo Layout (Turborepo):

apps/web        # Next.js app
packages/ui     # Component library + styleGuide.ts
packages/utils  # Shared helpers
packages/types  # Zod schemas & DB types
packages/functions # Inngest / Edge / RPC

Branching & CI
main → prod, dev/* → preview; GitHub Actions run ESLint, Type Checks, Jest, Playwright.
a11y & QA
Axe‑core CLI, Storybook stories w/ chromatic, 80 % coverage requirement.
Luna Context Instrumentation
Every visible UI element must be referenceable by Luna for precise, context‑aware actions.
• UIContextProvider exposes register(elementMeta) / update(id, state) / unregister(id) via React Context.
• Components call useUIContext(id, meta) hook on mount; meta includes role, route, type (Button, TableRow…), props, and isActive, isVisible flags.
• Provider serializes snapshots to a browser BroadcastChannel and via postMessage to the AI Chat Panel iframe so GPT functions can introspect live state.
• Debounced (2 s) snapshots POST to /api/ui-state → Supabase ui_contexts table (vectorized keywords) for historical queries and intent inference.
Security & Privacy
Only non‑PII UI metadata is sent to AI; component payloads are hashed when privacy flag set.

Rule: Every modal/drawer registers itself with useUIContext including isOpen, step, and parent route, so Luna can act within multi‑step flows.
---‑case screens: 404, 500, onboarding, first‑run wizard.)

🛠️ 3. UI‑First Build Sequence
Follow this order exactly. Mark each task ✅ in GitHub Projects when complete.
Scaffold Repo & Style Guide
npm dlx create‑next‑app → add Tailwind + path‑alias.
Create packages/ui/styleGuide.ts; run script to output Tailwind config tokens.
Add ESLint rule to forbid hard‑coded colors (no‑literal‑style).
AppShell & Navigation
Implement responsive layout using values from styleGuide; add collapsed nav, AI panel placeholder.
Atomic Component Library (see §1 tokens)
Build Button, Input, Card, Table, Toast, Modal, Tooltip, Tabs – export from packages/ui.
Route Stub Generation
For every row in UI inventory, create a Next.js page file with <Skeleton> placeholders.
Role‑Based Navigation Map
Generate navConfig.ts arrays per role; use Supabase Auth session to decide what links to show.
Screen‑Level Implementations
Work top‑down by role:
Super Admin pages
Admin pages
Teacher pages
Student pages
Parent pages
Dynamic State Mocking
Use MirageJS server to supply realistic JSON to feeds; keep UI interactive while backend lags behind.
🎯 Milestone M1 – UI Feature‑Complete & Style‑Compliant

🗄️ 4. Backend & Supabase — Feature‑Parity Build Guide
The data layer must mirror every screen, card, table, modal, and workflow enumerated in §2. This section details exact schemas, RLS, functions, triggers, and API routes required for each module. Finish each subsection before moving to the next UI feature.
4.1 Conventions & Ground Rules
Area
Rule
Naming
snake_case for DB; plural table names; id UUID PK; foreign keys named <ref>_id.
Timestamps
created_at DEFAULT now(), updated_at with trigger on UPDATE.
Soft Deletes
Use archived or active boolean, never hard DELETE except audit tables.
RLS
Always ON; define policies after seed; service role for Inngest only.
Auditing
audit_logs (id, table, action, before, after, actor_id, ts) auto‑filled by pg_trigger.
Indexes
Btree on FK columns; GIN on JSONB search; ivfflat on vector.
Storage
One bucket per org: org-{id}-uploads; public assets in org-{id}-public.
Coding
DB types exported to TypeScript via supabase gen types typescript --local > packages/types/db.ts.


4.2 Core Tables (Shared Across Roles)
organisations        (id, name, accent_color, logo_url)
users                (supabase auth schema)
members              (id, org_id, user_id, role enum('super_admin','admin','teacher','student','parent'))
audit_logs           (... see above)
ui_contexts          (id, org_id, user_id, route, snapshot_json, embedding vector(1536), created_at)
RLS: members.role IN ('super_admin','admin') OR user_id = auth.uid().

4.3 Teacher‑Centric Domain
4.3.1 Base‑Class & Instance Model (maps Teacher UI)
base_classes (
  id                 uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  org_id             uuid references organisations(id) on delete cascade,
  teacher_id         uuid references users(id),
  title              text,
  subject            text,
  syllabus_json      jsonb,
  active             boolean default true,
  created_at         timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at         timestamptz default now()
);

class_instances (
  id                 uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  base_class_id      uuid references base_classes(id) on delete cascade,
  title              text,
  period             text,
  enrollment_code    text unique,
  archived           boolean default false,
  start_date         date,
  end_date           date,
  created_at         timestamptz default now()
);

rosters (
  id                 uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  instance_id        uuid references class_instances(id) on delete cascade,
  student_id         uuid references users(id),
  joined_at          timestamptz default now()
);
Triggers:
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_enrollment_code()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.enrollment_code IS NULL THEN
    NEW.enrollment_code := lpad(to_hex(floor(random()*1e9)::int), 6, '0'); -- 6‑char base16
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER class_instances_bi BEFORE INSERT ON class_instances
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION set_enrollment_code();
Materialized View enrollment_code_lookup refreshes every minute via Supabase cron.
RLS:
Teachers: teacher_id = auth.uid() on base_classes and via join on instances.
Students: INSERT on rosters only via RPC (see below).
4.3.2 Paths, Lessons, Quizzes (StructureTabs)
paths          (id, base_class_id, title, sort_index)
lessons        (id, path_id, title, content_richtext jsonb, duration_est int)
lesson_sections(id, lesson_id, title, markdown text)
quizzes        (id, path_id, title, settings_json)
questions      (id, quiz_id, type enum('mcq','code','case'), body jsonb, answer jsonb)
submissions    (id, quiz_id, student_id, answers jsonb, score numeric, graded_at)
Indexes: (path_id, sort_index), GIN on content_richtext. RLS: Teachers on their org; students SELECT/INSERT submissions where student_id = auth.uid().
4.3.3 Inngest Workflows
Name
Trigger
Steps
propagate_base_class_change
UPDATE on paths, lessons, quizzes under a base class
① diff data → ② update each linked instance copy → ③ emit instance_changed event.
assessment.autograde
INSERT into submissions
Streams Q‑A to GPT, updates score & feedback.


4.4 Student Domain
Table impact: submissions, notebooks, mind_maps, achievements, certificates.
notebooks   (id, student_id, base_class_id, title)
mind_maps   (id, notebook_id, svg text)
achievements(id, student_id, competency_id, awarded_at)
certificates(id, student_id, name, file_url, issued_at)
RLS: student ownership; teachers SELECT for their classes via instance_id join.
RPC join_class_by_code(code text):
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION join_class_by_code(p_code text) RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE inst_id uuid;
BEGIN
  SELECT instance_id INTO inst_id FROM enrollment_code_lookup WHERE enrollment_code = p_code;
  IF inst_id IS NULL THEN RAISE EXCEPTION 'Invalid code'; END IF;
  INSERT INTO rosters(instance_id, student_id) VALUES (inst_id, auth.uid()) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
Policies allow EXECUTE to role anonymous with row‑level validations.

4.5 Admin & Super‑Admin Domain
Billing, feature flags, analytics tables:
subscriptions (id, org_id, stripe_customer, plan, status, current_period_end)
feature_flags (org_id, flag_key, enabled boolean)
usage_stats   (org_id, metric text, value numeric, ts)
Scheduled function collect_usage() aggregates storage size, vector count, API calls nightly.

4.6 API & Edge Function Map (Vercel /api/*)

4.7 Feature‑Parity Verification Checklist
UI Inventory → Table Matrix: For each row in §2, assert matching table(s)/fields exist in ERD. ✅
Modal Actions → RPC/Trigger: Every modal's primary CTA calls an API or RPC listed above. ✅
Widget KPIs → Materialized Views: Dashboard cards backed by SQL views refreshing ≤5 min. ✅
Edge Cases: Archiving flows, capacity limits, soft deletes handled? ✅
a11y & Audit: All triggers log to audit_logs; no silent data loss. ✅
🎯 Milestone M2 – Backend Schemas, Policies, API Routes Complete & Aligned to UI
Proceed to integrate front‑end data hooks only after M2 passes validation script npm run verify‑parity (compares ERD JSON vs UI inventory).

Supabase Project & Core Schema
• base_classes (id UUID PK, org_id, teacher_id, title, subject, syllabus_json, active boolean default true, created_at, updated_at).
• class_instances (id UUID PK, base_class_id FK, title, period, enrollment_code text UNIQUE, archived boolean default false, start_date, end_date, created_at).
• rosters (id, instance_id FK, student_id FK, joined_at).
• enrollment_code_lookup (materialized view: enrollment_code → instance_id) for O(1) joins.
• ui_contexts (unchanged).
• RLS: teachers can CRUD their own base_classes/instances; students insert into rosters via verified code; org admins override.
Triggers & Inngest Jobs
• base_classes_ai_update trigger → enqueue propagate_base_class_change Inngest job that diffs and patches linked instances (paths, lessons, quizzes).
• class_instances_biu trigger → on insert, generate secure base36 6‑char enrollment_code server‑side if null.
• RPC join_class_by_code(code text) validates active instance, non‑archived, capacity limits, then inserts into rosters.
Edge & RPC Endpoints
• POST /api/enroll (Students) → calls join_class_by_code.
• POST /api/base-class (Teachers) → create base class.
• POST /api/class-instance → create instance.
• Webhook PATCH /api/base-class/:id/propagate triggered by Inngest on content updates.
Remaining Backend Work
Knowledge ingestion, tutor chat, analytics, etc., now associate with base_class_id or instance_id as appropriate.

## ui / ux inventory mapping

Learnology AI Comprehensive Style Guide
Objective: Craft a clean, modern, premium AI‑First LMS—think Apple/Tesla with a pop of boldness—where every screen, tab, and page feels light, spacious, airy, and flowing, with intuitive UX/UI, seamless AI integration, and full theming for institutions (custom logos, accent colors), in both light and dark modes.

1. Brand Foundations
1.1 Logo
Primary Mark: "Brain‑dot" icon + Learnology AI wordmark.


Lockups:


Horizontal (icon left, wordmark right)


Vertical (icon above wordmark)


Clear Space: ≥ one dot‑height around.


Minimum Size: 32 px height (screen), 0.5 in (print).


1.2 Brand Colors
Default Accent Gradient:

Institution Accent Override
 Each organization supplies a primary accent color to replace the default gradient—used sparingly for buttons, links, and highlights.

2. Design Principles
Light, Spacious, Airy, Flowing


Whitespace: Generous padding (24–32 px) and margins to give components room to breathe.


Fluid Layouts: Flexible grids and cards that expand and contract smoothly with viewport changes.


Gentle Motion: Subtle, flowing transitions (200 ms ease‑in‑out) for collapse/expand, hover states, and modal fades—reinforcing an airy feel.


Simplicity & Clarity


Minimalist interfaces with clear hierarchy and focus on primary actions.


Progressive disclosure of advanced features behind "More" toggles.


Consistency


Reuse component patterns, spacing, and typography across all screens for predictability.


A unified iconography style and consistent color usage.


Intuitive AI Integration


AI controls (chat panel, tips, content generation) sit naturally within the flow—never obstructing core tasks.


Conversational UI elements guide users without overwhelming them.
